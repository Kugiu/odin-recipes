        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper. or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon white wine</li>
        <li>2 ounces pate</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>For the Wellingtons:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) filet mignon steaks</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
      </ul>  

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Melt butter over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and salt; cook and stir until well browned</p>
            <p>and caramelized, about 5 minutes. They will be wet and soggy at first but will dry out.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add shallots and cook until they soften up and turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add black</p>
            <p>pepper, cayenne, and white wine. Stir until wine evaporates, about 1 minute. Turn off the heat</p>
            <p>and transfer to a bowl to cool to room temperature.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add pate to cooled mushroom mixture; toss and mash with a spoon until thoroughly combined.</p>
            <p>Set aside.</p></li>
        <li>Generously season filets with salt and pepper. Melt butter for Wellingtons in the same pan over</p> 
            <p>high heat. Sear, one at a time, in the hot pan until the sides and edges are nicely browned</p>
            <p>about 5 minutes per filet. Transfer to a plate and place in the refrigerator until needed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cut each sheet of pastry into 4 squares. Place one square frozen puff pastry onto a lightly</p>
            <p>floured surface. Spoon about 3 tablespoons pate mixture into the center and press out to roughly</p>
            <p>the same size as a filet. Spread 1/2 tablespoon mustard on top of one filet and place mustard-side</p> 
            <p>down on the pate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Gently stretch and fold the shorter sides of the pastry around the filet, then bring the longer</p> 
            <p>sides up and over to seal. You can stretch the dough that will be on the bottom of the filet, but</p> 
            <p>try not to stretch it on the sides and top. It's okay to have a couple of small holes at the bottom.</p> 
            <p>Flip Wellington over and place seam-side down on a plate. Repeat to form remaining 3 Wellingtons</p> 
            <p>then transfer all to the refrigerator.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cut remaining 4 squares of puff pastry into circles that are roughly the size of the Wellingtons.</p> 
            <p>Place on the prepared sheet pan and poke all over each circle with a fork.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the center of the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, flip, and press</p> 
            <p>circles down with a spatula to flatten. Return to the oven and bake until cooked through and crispy</p> 
            <p>5 to 10 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and lift off the sheet pan to cool. Increase the oven</p> 
            <p>temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Transfer Wellingtons to the freezer for exactly 15 minutes. Line the same sheet pan with aluminum</p> 
            <p>foil, then top with parchment paper. Beat egg with water in a small bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>When Wellingtons have been in the freezer for 15 minutes, transfer to the prepared pan and generously</p> 
            <p>brush with egg wash.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake pastry in the center of the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and puffed and filets</p> 
            <p>are cooked through, 23 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read</p> 
            <p>122 degrees F (50 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Immediately remove from the hot pan and transfer onto a plate or cutting board for at least 5 minutes.</p> 
            <p>Cut Wellingtons in half, then trim each end to create a flat surface.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place each rounded pastry base on a plate and stand 2 filet halves on top with center cut facing up.</p></li>      
      </ol>
